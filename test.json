We combine theory with field-based methods in Arctic seas, temperate lakes and tropical floodplains. These study systems all share drastic seasonal fluctuations in environmental characteristics.",

These fossils therefore provide a unique opportunity for studies of the origin and evolutionary radiation of all amniotes.
